# TLX-Solutions

## What's this, anyway?

Well, to tell you the truth, I'm not quite sure what this is supposed to be... When this Git repo started, it was simply meant to be a place to store all my submissions and solutions to the [TLX Website](https://tlx.toki.id). No more, not less.

However, I do wish to share it and would be quite glad if my solutions would be used as a reference for people who would like to learn competitive programming. Making this public also opens the opportunity for critique in my solutions.

As of the time of writing of this README file, I expect to write most of the code in C, C++, and Python.

## What's TLX? Why?

[TLX](https://tlx.toki.id) is a Competitive Programming Training platform that is mostly intended for an Indonesian audience, including me. It is basically a clone to Leetcode, but offers a different UI and UX for the users.

TLX itself was created by the TOKI (Tim Olimpiade Komputer Indonesia) community, which is Indonesian Computer Olympics Team (yes, I'm just translating. No, I'm not ashamed of it.)

## Can I use this?

Yes, you definitely can. I made this code open source under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit). However, I have some disclaimers described by the next section.

## *Disclaimers*
1. The publisher of this Git repo and all of the code inside is not in any way an official partner of TLX, nor are we sponsored, endorsed, or otherwise affiliated in any way with TLX. We are merely another programmer using the platform to learn.
2. This repo is not meant in any way to facilitate cheating, unsportsmanlike behaviour, or other actions or behaviour that might violate the terms of service of the TLX platform or the unwritten rules of the wider internet.
3. As such, the publisher is not in any way responsible for any damages, misbehaviour, or any other violation of existing rules, bylaws, or terms of service as highlighted by the 2nd bullet point of the disclaimer.

That will be all from me. Happy coding, everyone!
