# Competitive Programming Submissions Collections

## Overview

Welcome to my repository, a growing collection of solutions to problems from various competitive programming platforms, including [TLX](https://tlx.toki.id), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), and [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com). Originally, this repo was just for my TLX submissions, but I’ve since expanded it to include solutions from LeetCode and Codewars as well. By making this public, I aim to provide a useful resource for fellow learners in the competitive programming community.

I’m excited to share my approaches and open them up for feedback, and I hope these solutions serve as helpful references. As of now, you’ll mostly find code written in C and Python.

## What Are TLX, LeetCode, and Codewars?

- **[TLX](https://tlx.toki.id)**: A competitive programming platform tailored for an Indonesian audience, TLX is created by [TOKI](https://toki.id) (Tim Olimpiade Komputer Indonesia), the Indonesian Computer Olympiad Team. It offers a wide variety of challenges that sharpen problem-solving skills, focusing on algorithmic thinking.

- **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)**: LeetCode is a globally recognized platform for coding challenges that is widely used by those preparing for technical interviews and enhancing their problem-solving capabilities. It features a large pool of problems that range in difficulty, and its vast community allows for discussions and solutions from diverse perspectives.

- **[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com)**: Codewars is a community-driven platform that offers coding challenges known as "kata." Users can solve problems in various programming languages and improve their skills through practice and peer feedback. The platform encourages learning through collaboration and gamification, making it a fun way to enhance coding abilities.

Both TLX, LeetCode, and Codewars are excellent resources for learning and practicing competitive programming skills, and my goal is to build solutions that reflect clear and effective problem-solving techniques.

## What’s Inside?

This repository contains solutions to problems from TLX, LeetCode, and Codewars, organized by problem type and difficulty level. The languages primarily used are:

- C
- C++
- Python

With a few solutions implemented in Java and Rust.

I may add more languages and problem categories in the future as the repository grows.

## Can I Use These Solutions?

Yes! All solutions in this repository are open-source under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit). Feel free to use them as references for your learning. However, I urge you to solve the problems on your own first before looking at any solution. Doing so will maximize the learning experience.

## Disclaimers

1. This repository is **not** officially affiliated with TLX, LeetCode, Codewars, or any other competitive programming platform. The solutions provided here are my own and are shared purely for educational purposes.
2. The purpose of this repository is to facilitate learning, **not to promote cheating** or any unsportsmanlike behavior that may violate the terms of service of TLX, LeetCode, Codewars, or any other platform.
